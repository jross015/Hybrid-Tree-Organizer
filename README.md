# Hybrid-Tree-Organizer
Implemented here is a hybrid tree structure that organizes nodes based on an integer value and a character letter.
Four pointers are included "left" and "right" for for nodes with differing integer values, and "leftchar" and "rightchar" for nodes with different letters.
Users are prompted to specific the number of nodes they want to add and each node's value and letter.
Trees can be traversed in inorder and reverse orders and the user can search for specific nodes based on letter and integer.
